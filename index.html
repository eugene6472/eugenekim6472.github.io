            Hello, my name is Juhwan(Eugene) Kim. I am a studnet at
            <a href="http://www.washington.edu/about//">University of Washington!</a>
            I am majoring Computer Science & Mathmatics.

        My father introduced me to golf when I was twelve years old, igniting both my competitive spirit and curiosity. To improve
        my game, I not only practiced, but also studied the relationship between oneâ€™s swing and equipment. I even visited
        an equipment factory on my own to better understand the engineering behind golf, which was my creative solution for
        the fact that my family could not afford private lessons. I was particularly captivated by the computer that produced
        equipment to exact specifications based on a code of zeros and ones. I thus kindled an early interest in computer
        science through my determination to become a strong golfer.

        I am currently developing an android game that will soon be released in the
        <strong>Google store</strong>. The game, called Connect Three, follows the rules of
        <strong>tic-tac-toe</strong>, shows user location, allows desktop play, and automatically determines the winner. User statistics
        like game time and number of victories are delivered to a server that uses
        <Strong>MySQL</Strong>S to store the information, and game results are delivered from the client using optimized tables.
        In the next version, I aim to prevent data loss and reduce unnecessary HTTP communication overhead through optimization
        of server communication.
